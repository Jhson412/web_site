            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ashley, an exchange student from Yonsei University in Korea, currently studying Business at UCR. 
                My journey to the U.S. has been an incredible experience, filled with opportunities to grow personally and academically. 
                I'm deeply passionate about integrating my major, Business, with my interest in the gaming industry. 
                Through courses at UCR and Yonsei, I've explored foundational topics such as marketing, financial analysis, 
                and organizational behavior, which have taught me how to analyze market trends, manage resources effectively, 
                and develop strategic thinking. These skills are invaluable as I aim to work in the intersection of business and gaming.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new cultures, playing Wild Rift and League of Legends (LoL), 
                and brainstorming creative ways to bring business solutions to life in the gaming world.
